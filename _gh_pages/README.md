# ðŸš€ B.C. Government Bootstrap v4 Theme

Simply put, a Bootstrap v4 B.C. Government Look-and-Feel featuring:
- 99% pure bootstrap, i.e., no custom classes
- NPM, Yarn and Bower package manager integration
- Sample HTML pages and common components like header and footers for rapid start.

The project is a successor to the previous [Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton](https://github.com/bcgov/Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton) 
and [mygovbc-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/bcgov/mygovbc-bootstrap-theme).  We combined the best of both projects 
and leverage the latest [Bootstrap v4-beta](http://getbootstrap.com/).
